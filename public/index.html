    <!-- So the idea is kind of for the simulator to have a responsive 'AI' for you to practice your interview with. And based on your answers the 'AI' responds differently. Of course, it's also meant to simulate the cheap looking simulators and quizzes you can find online with its pre-made answers, so the 'AI' isn't very good, nor is it meant to be. -->

<!-- So originally the idea was for this to be a pet simulator, but then I realised that the domain is too large so I switched it to an interview simulator that's aimed at people in their 3rd year/finishing their 3rd year of their bachelor's degree and are so painfully people-shy and avoidant and anti-social that this probably will actually help them with practicing for their interview without having to talk to actual people (I have friends like this). -->
<!-- Originally I also considered recording myself asking the questions and inserting them in each section but I did not want videos of myself floating around on the internet so that idea was vetoed immediately after conception. 'hello.jpg' fits the theme of a random, not-made-by-a-business-looking-for-your-hard-earned-cash-just-because-you-don't-know-how-to-talk-to-people-simulator you would find online better anyways. -->
